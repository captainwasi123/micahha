            <p> Any user may access the TOS from any page of the Site. </p>
            <p> The TOS are applicable without restriction or reserve to all the Items offered for sale on the Site. </p>
            <p> Any Order on the Site is conditional upon the prior consultation and acceptance, without reserve, of these TOS and applicable tariffs by the Customer. </p>
            <p> The validation of an Order following the order procedure offered on the site requires acceptance of these TOS. </p>
            <p> These TOS shall take precedence over any other document. </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h4 class="col-black"> 3. ATTENTION </h4>
            <p> The sale of Items on the Site is exclusively reserved to retail sales and sales to private individuals. </p>
            <p> In no case may the Site be used by professional retail Customers, alone or together, and regardless of the method of marketing their products (on the internet, in shopping malls, intermediaries, and including physical stores). The Customer acknowledges and agrees therefore that the items can only be purchased in quantities reflecting average consumer needs, both in terms of the number of items ordered in one order and the number of individual Orders respecting the usual amount an average consumer places for the same product. Sandro reserves the right to refuse to fulfill an order clearly validated by a professional retail Customer. </p>
            <p> All Customers are informed of the lack of reliability of the Internet, especially in terms of relative security in data transmission, continuity in unsecured access to the Site, non-guaranteed performance in terms of the volume and speed of data transmission and virus propagation. </p>
            <p> Sandro warns each Customer of the need to implement on his/her computer, portable or mobile solution any security measures likely to prevent the spread of viruses. </p>
            <p> As the TOS are the subject of modifications, the applicable conditions are those in effect on the Site on the day the order is placed. </p>
            <p> Handling of a defective or non-compliant item (replacement or refund) or the exercise of a right to cancel and return an order cannot be carried out in physical Sandro stores. </p>
            <p> All claims concerning the Items purchased online on the Site must be handled online. Likewise, an Item purchased in any Sandro store cannot be processed via the Site.  </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h4> 4. CREATION OF A CUSTOMER ACCOUNT </h4>
            <p> Placing an Order via the Site requires the prior creation of a customer account. </p>
            <p> Any adult Customer may freely and at no charge create a customer account through the "Create an account" section. </p>
            <p> Creation of a customer account is completed by the Customer by filling out the form requesting identification information. </p>
            <p> This account is strictly personal and enables an individual to log in before placing an Order. </p>
            <p> When creating the customer account, the customer enters data that allows his/her identification under his/her full responsibility, control and direction and is committed to providing complete, accurate and timely information, and not to assume the identity of a third party, nor hide or change his/her age. </p>
            <p> During the creation of a Customer Account, the Customer enters his/her email address and chooses their password. </p>
            <p> If the email address is already assigned, the system prompts a message to choose another. Passwords are personal and confidential. The Customer is solely responsible for them. </p>
            <p> The Customer undertakes to keep his/her password secret and to not disclose it under any context and for any reason whatsoever. </p>
            <p> If it is suspected that a username and password has been used by a third party, the Customer must immediately alert Sandro to change his/her password and/or choose to close his/her account. Sandro reserves the possibility to close any customer account and refuse any sale to a Customer in the following cases. </p>
            <ul class="list-style1">
               <li> lack of payment for one or several past Orders, </li>
               <li> abuse, unfair or fraudulent use of the Order service provided on the Site or failure to respect any of the Customer's obligations set out in the TOS. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> In this case, Sandro will send an email to the Customer concerned, via the address communicated by the latter during the creation of his/her 
               customer account, informing the deactivation of his/her username and password and the closing of the account. 
            </p>
            <p> Generally speaking, the Customer is informed of the fact that his/her account may be closed following the first request of the Customer issued by
               email to Sandro.

            <p> The Customer recognises and accepts that the proof of acceptance of the TOS is characterised by placing an order at sandro-paris.com.au </p>
            <p> For this purpose, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that the electronic data stored in Sandro computer servers in reasonable conditions of security and integrity are considered, irrefutably, as evidence of acceptance of the terms of the TOS and the proof of all transactions between the Customer and Sandro. </p>

            <p> Thus, these elements constitute proof and, if they are produced as evidence by Sandro in any litigation or otherwise, shall be admissible, valid and opposable in the same manner, under the same conditions and with the same probative value as any document created, received or retained in writing. </p>
            <p> At any time, the Customer can print, download and save a copy of the TOS to a paper or electronic medium. </p>
